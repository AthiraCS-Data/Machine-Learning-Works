ðŸ§  Machine Learning Mini-Projects
Welcome to my repository of Machine Learning practice works and mini-projects.
This space is dedicated to my learning journey in Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Visualization, where I practice core ML concepts, work on small datasets, and improve my analytical thinking.

âœ¨ Repository Highlights:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Exercises
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Visualizations
Basic Supervised Learning Models (Classification & Regression)
Confusion Matrix & Evaluation Metric Calculations
Small-scale Data Insights Reports
Power BI Mini Dashboards for Business Scenarios

ðŸ”§ Technologies Practiced:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Power BI (DAX, Slicers, KPI Cards)
SQL (Basic Querying)
Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest â€“ beginner level)

ðŸš€ Goal of This Repository:
This repository serves as a practice ground for enhancing my data analysis and machine learning skills by working on small projects, datasets, and solving mini business scenarios step-by-step.
